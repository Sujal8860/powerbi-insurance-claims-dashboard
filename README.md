# Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis â€” Power BI

A one-page **Power BI** dashboard analyzing insurance **policies, claims, customer demographics, and vehicle attributes**.  
Built to practice clean modeling, reusable DAX, and clear storytelling.

## âœ¨ Highlights
- KPIs: **Total Policies, Total Claim Amount, Avg Claim Freq, Avg Claim Amount**
- Slices: **Age Groups, Education, Marital Status, Gender, Kids Driving**
- Vehicle: **Car Use, Car Make, Car Year** (trend)
- Interactivity: cross-filtering, label formatting, outside data labels for small slices

## ðŸ’¡ Why this project
Festive season = learning season. I revisited fundamentals to stay sharp.
(PS: I also build advanced multi-page dashboards with complex DAX and Row-Level Security.)


## ðŸ§® Key DAX
See `src/dax/measures.md` for copy-ready measures:
- `Total Policies`, `Total Claim Amount`, `Claim Frequency`
- `Avg Claim Amount`, `YTD/MTD` variants
- Age grouping & income bands
